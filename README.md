## 🚀 Introduction

**E-Certification Automation** is a Python-powered solution to simplify and speed up the process of generating and distributing digital certificates for participants in events, workshops, or academic programs.

In many colleges and competitions, participants often receive physical certificates — if any. Manually customizing each digital certificate? Tedious. This project automates the **entire flow** — from data collection to certificate delivery.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Automated Certificate Generation**  
  Generate personalized certificates without manually editing names.

- 🧾 **Google Forms/Sheets Integration**  
  Fetch participant data directly from Google Forms responses stored in Google Sheets.

- 📩 **Effortless Distribution**  
  Automatically send certificates to recipients via email.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Collect Data**  
   Get participant info using Google Forms — automatically stored in Google Sheets.

2. **Generate Certificates**  
   Script overlays participant names and details onto a pre-designed certificate template (PNG/PDF).

3. **Send Certificates**  
   Emails with attached certificates are sent to participants — hands-free.
