E-Certification Automation

Introduction

E-Certification is the process of automating the generation and distribution of participation or achievement certificates using programming and scripting.

In colleges and various events, participants often receive physical certificates, while digital certificates may not always be issued or easily accessible. Sometimes, only a limited group, such as winners or runner-ups, receive them. Manually editing each certificate can be time-consuming and inefficient.

This project automates the entire certification process, from collecting participant details via Google Forms/Google Sheets to generating and sending personalized certificates effortlessly.

Features

Automated Certificate Generation: No need to manually edit names on soft copies.

Google Forms/Sheets Integration: Fetches participant details directly.

Effortless Distribution: Certificates are emailed to recipients automatically.

Customizable Templates: Supports different certificate designs.


How It Works

1. Collect Data: Fetch participant details from Google Forms/Sheets.


2. Generate Certificates: Automatically insert names and other details into a predefined certificate template.


3. Send Certificates: Distribute personalized certificates via email.



Why Use This Project?

Saves time by eliminating manual work.

Ensures every participant receives their certificate without missing out.

Improves efficiency for event organizers.
